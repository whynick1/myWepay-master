Summary

1. What is SSL?
	Secure Shell (SSH) provides a secure channel over an unsecured network


2. Authentication
	1) SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer
	2) allow remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary


3. Key management
	1) On Unix-like systems, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	2) use manually generated public-private key pair to perform authentication
		-- when the public key is present on the remote end and the matching private key is present on the local end, password is no longer required.

4. Vagrant-google ssh
