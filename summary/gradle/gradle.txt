Summary

1. CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous delivery)
    1) push project to artifactory
        (1) create gradle project & teamcity project with Slingshot
            ref: https://slingshot.devops.wepay-inc.com/project

        (2) handle artifact release version
            `deploy_version` gets generated based on the tag `release_type` specified in the PR description
            example: release_type: major|minor|patch (choose just one)
            ref: https://confluence.corp.wepay-inc.com/display/DevOps/Docker+-+Service+Artifact+Labeling

    2) libs-release-local-secure VS libs-release-local VS libs-release
        (1) `libs-release-local` for developers testing (should not be included by other services)
        
        (2) `libs-release-local-secure` is defined to store artifacts built on master in secure build system.
        
        (3) both accessible with a virtual repo `libs-release`

        (4) when create TeamCity project with Slingshot, "extra" publish repo will be added to `artifactoryPublish`
            -- extra publish repos: ibs-release-local for DevBuild; libs-release-local-secure for MasterBuild
            -- in build.gradle, leave `repoKey = 'libs-release'`(consistent with gradle project generated with Slingshot)

2. gradlew vs gradle
    1) ./gradlew is a gradle wrapper that facilitates installation of gradle
        
    2) without which you would have to manually install gradle
    
    3)./gradlew is more convenient and version consistent across machines


3. suppress checkstyle/findbugs warning
