Summary

1. pull request guide
	1). review your own pr like never read it before 
		(1) not just focus on critical logic
		(2) be careful about coding style and intent
		(3) read with naive mind, add necessary commment if hard to understand

	2). how to add comment
		(1) use @link/@see when necessary

	3). how to add log
		(1) add log at entry point, not inside process block
		(2) consider use logger.debug/warn rather than info in specific case

	4). unit test
		(1) be careful when adding @Before; instead use a helper method to init objects
		(2) use ArgumentCaptor to capture argument values for further assertions

	5). coding style issue
		(1) implicitly use null/None/new Collection<>() to indicate return "empty"
		(2) consider pass whole object rather than just its property in case of future change

	6) run "flake8 airflow tests" before raise pull request
