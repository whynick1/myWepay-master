Summary

1. when want to get if map contains
	prefer xxx = get(A, Default) 
	than if else

2. Construct a dict within one line
	dict(map(lambda xxx: (xxx.id, xxx), xxxs))

4. when & why to use generator
	make solution clearer, and avoid building huge lists of results

8. solving PY3 `byte` type not support by json.dump by extending JSONEncoder

9. encoding & decoding
	1) UTF-8
	text encoding - encoding text as binary data
	variable length encoding, 1-4 bytes per code point

	2) ASCII
	encoded as ASCII using 1 byte
	defines 128 characters, which map to the numbers 0–127

	3) Base64
	byte encoding - encoding arbitrary binary data as ASCII text

	4) Unicode
	a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0–128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode
	unicode characters don't generally fit into one 8-bit byte, there are numerous ways of storing Unicode characters in byte sequences, such as UTF-32 and UTF-8

	5) BQ immported BYTES data must be base64-encoded
		encode byte(py3) and str(py2) with base64
